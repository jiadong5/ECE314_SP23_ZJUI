## Academic Integrity Statement ##

By submitting the lab with this statement, you declare you have written up the lab entirely by yourself, including both code and markdown cells. You also agree that you should not share your code with anyone else. Any violation of the academic integrity requirement may cause an academic integrity report to be filed that could go into your student record. See <a href="https://provost.illinois.edu/policies/policies/academic-integrity/students-quick-reference-guide-to-academic-integrity/">Students' Quick Reference Guide to Academic Integrity</a> for more information.
